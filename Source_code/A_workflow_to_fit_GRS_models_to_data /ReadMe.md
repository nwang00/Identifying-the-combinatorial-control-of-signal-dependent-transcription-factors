### Optimization framework with error models
The optimization has been performed by `Nondyn_opt_0.02_imp.R` (Time-Value error model) and `Nondyn_Con_opt_0.02_imp.R` (Conventional error model).

### Analysis for optimization of simulated data
Performance evaluation of developed optimization framework has been performed with `Optimization_analysis_0.02_f.R`. User could leverage standardized script `Optimization_framework.R` under folder `Optimization_framework` for GRS estimation.

### Evalueate optimization framework with different data uncertainty levels
We examined performance of developed optimization framework with different data uncertainty levels by `Optimization_results_all.R` under folder `Optimization_different_error_level`.
