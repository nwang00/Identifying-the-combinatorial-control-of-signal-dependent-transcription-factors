## Experimental data uncertainty estimation
Experimental data uncertainty level has been estimated by `Error_Model_ExpData_Infer.R`.

### Fitting the model to experimental data
We used `Gene_fitting.R` to fit the model for individual gene from experimental data.

### Downstream analysis for experimental data fitting
The downstream analysis for experimental data fitting is performed by `Fitting_downstream_analysis_update.R`. The supplementary figures have been generated by scripts `Fitting_downstream_analysis_raw_variance_S7FigC.R` and `Gene_synergy_S7FigD.R`.
