### GRS identifiability analysis with simple perturbation
We examined GRS identifiability with simple perturbation with `Figure2_clustering.R`.

### GRS identifiability analysis with multiple TF dynamics
We examined GRS identifiability with multiple TF dynamics by `Figure2_cut_tree.R`.

### GRS identifiability validation with random sampling approach
We performed the random sampling approach to validate our analysis with `Figure2_random_sampling.R`.
